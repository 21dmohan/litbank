QUOTE	Q290	31	0	31	21	" I think , Watson , that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you . "
QUOTE	Q291	32	0	32	3	" Seven ! "
QUOTE	Q292	34	0	37	13	" Indeed , I should have thought a little more . Just a trifle more , I fancy , Watson . And in practice again , I observe . You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness . "
QUOTE	Q293	38	0	38	8	" Then , how do you know ? "
QUOTE	Q294	39	0	40	26	" I see it , I deduce it . How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately , and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl ? "
QUOTE	Q295	41	0	41	5	" My dear Holmes , "
QUOTE	Q296	41	9	44	32	" this is too much . You would certainly have been burned , had you lived a few centuries ago . It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess , but as I have changed my clothes I ca n't imagine how you deduce it . As to Mary Jane , she is incorrigible , and my wife has given her notice , but there , again , I fail to see how you work it out . "
QUOTE	Q297	46	0	46	6	" It is simplicity itself , "
QUOTE	Q298	46	10	49	71	" my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe , just where the firelight strikes it , the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts . Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it . Hence , you see , my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather , and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey . As to your practice , if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform , with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger , and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope , I must be dull , indeed , if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession . "
QUOTE	Q299	51	0	51	9	" When I hear you give your reasons , "
QUOTE	Q300	51	13	52	13	" the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself , though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process . And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours . "
QUOTE	Q301	53	0	53	4	" Quite so , "
QUOTE	Q302	54	0	56	19	" You see , but you do not observe . The distinction is clear . For example , you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room . "
QUOTE	Q303	57	0	57	3	" Frequently . "
QUOTE	Q304	58	0	58	4	" How often ? "
QUOTE	Q305	59	0	59	8	" Well , some hundreds of times . "
QUOTE	Q306	60	0	60	7	" Then how many are there ? "
QUOTE	Q307	61	0	62	5	" How many ? I do n't know . "
QUOTE	Q308	63	0	68	34	" Quite so ! You have not observed . And yet you have seen . That is just my point . Now , I know that there are seventeen steps , because I have both seen and observed . By-the-way , since you are interested in these little problems , and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences , you may be interested in this . "
QUOTE	Q309	70	0	70	8	" It came by the last post , "
QUOTE	Q310	71	0	71	5	" Read it aloud . "
QUOTE	Q311	73	0	73	15	" There will call upon you to-night , at a quarter to eight o'clock , "
QUOTE	Q312	73	19	76	22	" a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment . Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated . This account of you we have from all quarters received . Be in your chamber then at that hour , and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask . "
QUOTE	Q313	77	0	77	7	" This is indeed a mystery , "
QUOTE	Q314	78	0	78	9	" What do you imagine that it means ? "
QUOTE	Q315	79	0	83	7	" I have no data yet . It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data . Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories , instead of theories to suit facts . But the note itself . What do you deduce from it ? "
QUOTE	Q316	85	0	85	12	" The man who wrote it was presumably well to do , "
QUOTE	Q317	86	0	87	7	" Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet . It is peculiarly strong and stiff . "
QUOTE	Q318	88	0	88	9	" Peculiar -- that is the very word , "
QUOTE	Q319	89	0	90	7	" It is not an English paper at all . Hold it up to the light . "
QUOTE	Q324	94	0	98	8	" Not at all . The ' G ' with the small ' t ' stands for ' Gesellschaft , ' which is the German for ' Company . ' It is a customary contraction like our ' Co. ' ' P , ' of course , stands for ' Papier . ' Now for the ' Eg . ' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer . "
QUOTE	Q325	100	0	103	14	" Eglow , Eglonitz -- here we are , Egria . It is in a German-speaking country -- in Bohemia , not far from Carlsbad . ' Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein , and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills . ' Ha , ha , my boy , what do you make of that ? "
QUOTE	Q326	105	0	105	8	" The paper was made in Bohemia , "
QUOTE	Q327	106	0	112	17	" Precisely . And the man who wrote the note is a German . Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence -- ' This account of you we have from all quarters received . ' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that . It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs . It only remains , therefore , to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face . And here he comes , if I am not mistaken , to resolve all our doubts . "
QUOTE	Q320	92	0	92	8	" What do you make of that ? "
QUOTE	Q321	93	0	93	16	" The name of the maker , no doubt ; or his monogram , rather . "
