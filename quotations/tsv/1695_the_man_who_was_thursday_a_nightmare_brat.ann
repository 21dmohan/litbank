QUOTE	Q249	48	0	48	6	“ It may well be , ”
QUOTE	Q250	48	16	50	18	“ it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet . You say you are a poet of law ; I say you are a contradiction in terms . I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden . ”
QUOTE	Q251	54	0	54	9	“ An artist is identical with an anarchist , ”
QUOTE	Q252	55	0	61	19	“ You might transpose the words anywhere . An anarchist is an artist . The man who throws a bomb is an artist , because he prefers a great moment to everything . He sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light , one peal of perfect thunder , than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen . An artist disregards all governments , abolishes all conventions . The poet delights in disorder only . If it were not so , the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground Railway . ”
QUOTE	Q253	62	0	62	5	“ So it is , ”
QUOTE	Q254	63	0	63	3	“ Nonsense ! ”
QUOTE	Q255	64	0	70	22	“ Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired , so very sad and tired ? I will tell you . It is because they know that the train is going right . It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach . It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria , and nothing but Victoria . Oh , their wild rapture ! oh , their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden , if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street ! ”
QUOTE	Q256	71	0	71	8	“ It is you who are unpoetical , ”
QUOTE	Q257	72	0	81	7	“ If what you say of clerks is true , they can only be as prosaic as your poetry . The rare , strange thing is to hit the mark ; the gross , obvious thing is to miss it . We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird . Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station ? Chaos is dull ; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere , to Baker Street or to Bagdad . But man is a magician , and his whole magic is in this , that he does say Victoria , and lo ! it is Victoria . No , take your books of mere poetry and prose ; let me read a time table , with tears of pride . Take your Byron , who commemorates the defeats of man ; give me Bradshaw , who commemorates his victories . Give me Bradshaw , I say ! ”
QUOTE	Q258	82	0	82	5	“ Must you go ? ”
QUOTE	Q259	83	0	83	5	“ I tell you , ”
QUOTE	Q260	83	12	88	16	“ that every time a train comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers , and that man has won a battle against chaos . You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria . I say that one might do a thousand things instead , and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape . And when I hear the guard shout out the word ‘ Victoria , ’ it is not an unmeaning word . It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest . It is to me indeed ‘ Victoria ’ ; it is the victory of Adam . ”
QUOTE	Q261	90	0	90	5	“ And even then , ”
QUOTE	Q262	90	9	94	7	“ we poets always ask the question , ‘ And what is Victoria now that you have got there ? ’ You think Victoria is like the New Jerusalem . We know that the New Jerusalem will only be like Victoria . Yes , the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven . The poet is always in revolt . ”
QUOTE	Q263	95	0	95	4	“ There again , ”
QUOTE	Q264	95	9	100	5	“ what is there poetical about being in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to be sea-sick . Being sick is a revolt . Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions ; but I ’m hanged if I can see why they are poetical . Revolt in the abstract is -- revolting . It ’s mere vomiting . ”
