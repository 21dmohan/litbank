They stretch 'em out with two ropes -- calves , remember ! Little , weenty fellers you could pack under one arm ! Yuh ca n't blame 'em much . They never have more 'n thirty or forty head to brand at a time , and they never git more 'n a taste uh real work . So they make the most uh what they git , and go in heavy on fancy outfits .
