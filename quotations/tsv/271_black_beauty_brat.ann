QUOTE	Q348	10	27	13	42	“ I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you . The colts who live here are very good colts , but they are cart-horse colts , and of course they have not learned manners . You have been well-bred and well-born ; your father has a great name in these parts , and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races ; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew , and I think you have never seen me kick or bite . I hope you will grow up gentle and good , and never learn bad ways ; do your work with a good will , lift your feet up well when you trot , and never bite or kick even in play . ”

QUOTE	Q359	52	0	53	38	“ Oh ! I do n’t know what hare ; likely enough it may be one of our own hares out of the woods ; any hare they can find will do for the dogs and men to run after ; ”
