QUOTE	Q2138	87	2	98	12	" I was actually in a man 's arms . Such a nice chap ! Such a dear fellow ! And I was saying to myself , fiercely , hissing it between my teeth , as they say in novels -- and really clenching them together : I was saying to myself : ' Now , I 'm in for it and I 'll really have a good time for once in my life -- for once in my life ! ' It was in the dark , in a carriage , coming back from a hunt ball . Eleven miles we had to drive ! And then suddenly the bitterness of the endless poverty , of the endless acting -- it fell on me like a blight , it spoilt everything . Yes , I had to realize that I had been spoilt even for the good time when it came . And I burst out crying and I cried and I cried for the whole eleven miles . Just imagine me crying ! And just imagine me making a fool of the poor dear chap like that . It certainly was n't playing the game , was it now ? "
