QUOTE	Q334	49	0	56	35	‘ I ’m tired of it too , dead-tired of doing nothing more except play the squire in a country that is sick of squires . For a year or more I have been getting as restless as an old elephant who scents danger . I am always dreaming of Kukuanaland and Gagool and King Solomon ’s Mines . I can assure you I have become the victim of an almost unaccountable craving . I am sick of shooting pheasants and partridges , and want to have a go at some large game again . There , you know the feeling -- when one has once tasted brandy and water , milk becomes insipid to the palate . That year we spent together up in Kukuanaland seems to me worth all the other years of my life put together . I dare say that I am a fool for my pains , but I ca n’t help it ; I long to go , and , what is more , I mean to go . ’

QUOTE	Q339	88	0	88	7	‘ It ’s a big order , ’
QUOTE	Q340	89	9	94	19	‘ it is ; but I take it that we are all three of us in search of a big order . We want a change of scene , and we are likely to get one -- a thorough change . All my life I have longed to visit those parts , and I mean to do it before I die . My poor boy ’s death has broken the last link between me and civilization , and I ’m off to my native wilds . And now I ’ll tell you another thing , and that is , that for years and years I have heard rumours of a great white race which is supposed to have its home somewhere up in this direction , and I have a mind to see if there is any truth in them . If you fellows like to come , well and good ; if not , I ’ll go alone . ’
