But Grospierre was a fool . The market carts were going through the gates ; there was one laden with casks , and driven by an old man , with a boy beside him . Grospierre was a bit drunk , but he thought himself very clever ; he looked into the casks -- most of them , at least -- and saw they were empty , and let the cart go through . ”
