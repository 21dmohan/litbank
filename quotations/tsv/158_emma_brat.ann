QUOTE	Q345	34	38	36	13	“ Poor Miss Taylor ! -- I wish she were here again . What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her ! ”
QUOTE	Q346	37	0	38	52	“ I can not agree with you , papa ; you know I can not . Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ; -- and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? ”
QUOTE	Q347	39	0	42	12	“ A house of her own ! -- But where is the advantage of a house of her own ? This is three times as large . -- And you have never any odd humours , my dear . ”
QUOTE	Q348	43	0	45	16	“ How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us ! -- We shall be always meeting ! _ We _ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon . ”
QUOTE	Q349	46	0	48	8	“ My dear , how am I to get so far ? Randalls is such a distance . I could not walk half so far . ”
QUOTE	Q350	49	0	50	11	“ No , papa , nobody thought of your walking . We must go in the carriage , to be sure . ”
QUOTE	Q351	51	0	52	32	“ The carriage ! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ; -- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ? ”
QUOTE	Q352	53	0	60	16	“ They are to be put into Mr. Weston 's stable , papa . You know we have settled all that already . We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night . And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter 's being housemaid there . I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . That was your doing , papa . You got Hannah that good place . Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- James is so obliged to you ! ”
QUOTE	Q353	61	0	66	12	“ I am very glad I did think of her . It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty-spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her . Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us . He will be able to tell her how we all are . ”
QUOTE	Q355	74	10	75	11	“ It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . ”
