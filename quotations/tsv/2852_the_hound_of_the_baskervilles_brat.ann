QUOTE	Q308	15	0	15	4	“ I think , ”
QUOTE	Q309	15	20	15	46	“ that Dr. Mortimer is a successful , elderly medical man , well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation . ”

QUOTE	Q313	19	0	19	4	“ Why so ? ”
QUOTE	Q314	20	0	21	23	“ Because this stick , though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it . The thick-iron ferrule is worn down , so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it . ”
QUOTE	Q315	22	0	22	4	“ Perfectly sound ! ”
QUOTE	Q316	23	0	23	49	“ And then again , there is the ‘ friends of the C.C.H. ’ I should guess that to be the Something Hunt , the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance , and which has made him a small presentation in return . ”
QUOTE	Q317	24	0	24	9	“ Really , Watson , you excel yourself , ”
QUOTE	Q318	25	0	28	16	“ I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities . It may be that you are not yourself luminous , but you are a conductor of light . Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it . I confess , my dear fellow , that I am very much in your debt . ”
QUOTE	Q319	33	0	33	6	“ Interesting , though elementary , ”
QUOTE	Q320	34	0	35	9	“ There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick . It gives us the basis for several deductions . ”
QUOTE	Q321	36	0	36	6	“ Has anything escaped me ? ”
QUOTE	Q322	38	0	38	14	“ I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked ? ”
QUOTE	Q323	39	0	43	7	“ I am afraid , my dear Watson , that most of your conclusions were erroneous . When I said that you stimulated me I meant , to be frank , that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth . Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance . The man is certainly a country practitioner . And he walks a good deal . ”
QUOTE	Q324	44	0	44	6	“ Then I was right . ”
QUOTE	Q325	45	0	45	5	“ To that extent . ”
QUOTE	Q326	46	0	46	6	“ But that was all . ”
QUOTE	Q327	47	0	48	50	“ No , no , my dear Watson , not all -- by no means all . I would suggest , for example , that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt , and that when the initials ‘ C.C. ’ are placed before that hospital the words ‘ Charing Cross ’ very naturally suggest themselves . ”
QUOTE	Q328	49	0	49	6	“ You may be right . ”
QUOTE	Q329	50	0	51	25	“ The probability lies in that direction . And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor . ”
QUOTE	Q330	52	0	52	26	“ Well , then , supposing that ‘ C.C.H. ’ does stand for ‘ Charing Cross Hospital , ’ what further inferences may we draw ? ”
QUOTE	Q331	53	0	55	3	“ Do none suggest themselves ? You know my methods . Apply them ! ”
QUOTE	Q332	56	0	56	22	“ I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country . ”
QUOTE	Q333	57	0	64	23	“ I think that we might venture a little farther than this . Look at it in this light . On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made ? When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will ? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself . We know there has been a presentation . We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice . Is it , then , stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change ? ”
QUOTE	Q334	65	0	65	6	“ It certainly seems probable . ”
QUOTE	Q335	66	0	70	56	“ Now , you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital , since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position , and such a one would not drift into the country . What was he , then ? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician -- little more than a senior student . And he left five years ago -- the date is on the stick . So your grave , middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air , my dear Watson , and there emerges a young fellow under thirty , amiable , unambitious , absent-minded , and the possessor of a favourite dog , which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff . ”
QUOTE	Q336	72	0	72	15	“ As to the latter part , I have no means of checking you , ”
QUOTE	Q337	72	19	72	42	“ but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man ’s age and professional career . ”
QUOTE	Q338	76	0	83	14	“ Mortimer , James , M.R.C.S. , 1882 , Grimpen , Dartmoor , Devon . House-surgeon , from 1882 to 1884 , at Charing Cross Hospital . Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology , with essay entitled ‘ Is Disease a Reversion ? ’ Corresponding member of the Swedish Pathological Society . Author of ‘ Some Freaks of Atavism ’ ( Lancet 1882 ) . ‘ Do We Progress ? ’ ( Journal of Psychology , March , 1883 ) . Medical Officer for the parishes of Grimpen , Thorsley , and High Barrow . ”
QUOTE	Q339	84	0	84	10	“ No mention of that local hunt , Watson , ”
QUOTE	Q340	84	18	87	52	“ but a country doctor , as you very astutely observed . I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences . As to the adjectives , I said , if I remember right , amiable , unambitious , and absent-minded . It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials , only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country , and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room . ”
QUOTE	Q341	88	0	88	5	“ And the dog ? ”
QUOTE	Q342	89	0	92	16	“ Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master . Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle , and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible . The dog ’s jaw , as shown in the space between these marks , is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff . It may have been -- yes , by Jove , it is a curly-haired spaniel . ”
QUOTE	Q343	96	0	96	15	“ My dear fellow , how can you possibly be so sure of that ? ”
QUOTE	Q344	97	0	102	3	“ For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step , and there is the ring of its owner . Do n’t move , I beg you , Watson . He is a professional brother of yours , and your presence may be of assistance to me . Now is the dramatic moment of fate , Watson , when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life , and you know not whether for good or ill . What does Dr. James Mortimer , the man of science , ask of Sherlock Holmes , the specialist in crime ? Come in ! ”
