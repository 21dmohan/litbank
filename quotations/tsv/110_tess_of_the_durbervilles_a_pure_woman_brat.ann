QUOTE	Q309	8	0	8	45	" Now , sir , begging your pardon ; we met last market-day on this road about this time , and I said ' Good night , ' and you made reply ' _ Good night , Sir John _ , ' as now . "
QUOTE	Q310	9	0	9	4	" I did , "
QUOTE	Q311	10	0	10	11	" And once before that -- near a month ago . "
QUOTE	Q312	11	0	11	5	" I may have . "
QUOTE	Q313	12	0	12	28	" Then what might your meaning be in calling me ' Sir John ' these different times , when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield , the haggler ? "
QUOTE	Q314	14	0	14	7	" It was only my whim , "
QUOTE	Q315	14	19	16	52	" It was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago , whilst I was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history . I am Parson Tringham , the antiquary , of Stagfoot Lane . Do n't you really know , Durbeyfield , that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly family of the d'Urbervilles , who derive their descent from Sir Pagan d'Urberville , that renowned knight who came from Normandy with William the Conqueror , as appears by Battle Abbey Roll ? "
QUOTE	Q316	17	0	17	8	" Never heard it before , sir ! "
QUOTE	Q317	18	0	25	46	" Well it 's true . Throw up your chin a moment , so that I may catch the profile of your face better . Yes , that 's the d'Urberville nose and chin -- a little debased . Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of Glamorganshire . Branches of your family held manors over all this part of England ; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the time of King Stephen . In the reign of King John one of them was rich enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers ; and in Edward the Second 's time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the great Council there . You declined a little in Oliver Cromwell 's time , but to no serious extent , and in Charles the Second 's reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty . Aye , there have been generations of Sir Johns among you , and if knighthood were hereditary , like a baronetcy , as it practically was in old times , when men were knighted from father to son , you would be Sir John now . "
QUOTE	Q318	26	0	26	7	" Ye do n't say so ! "
QUOTE	Q319	27	0	27	4	" In short , "
QUOTE	Q320	27	17	27	27	" there 's hardly such another family in England . "
QUOTE	Q321	28	0	28	10	" Daze my eyes , and is n't there ? "
QUOTE	Q322	30	0	30	48	" And here have I been knocking about , year after year , from pillar to post , as if I was no more than the commonest feller in the parish ... And how long hev this news about me been knowed , Pa ' son Tringham ? "
QUOTE	Q323	33	0	33	17	" At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of information , "
QUOTE	Q324	34	0	35	13	" However , our impulses are too strong for our judgement sometimes . I thought you might perhaps know something of it all the while . "
QUOTE	Q325	36	0	40	51	" Well , I have heard once or twice , 't is true , that my family had seen better days afore they came to Blackmoor . But I took no notice o ' t , thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep only one . I 've got a wold silver spoon , and a wold graven seal at home , too ; but , Lord , what 's a spoon and seal ? ... And to think that I and these noble d'Urbervilles were one flesh all the time . 'T was said that my gr ' t-granfer had secrets , and did n't care to talk of where he came from ... And where do we raise our smoke , now , parson , if I may make so bold ; I mean , where do we d'Urbervilles live ? "
QUOTE	Q326	41	0	42	9	" You do n't live anywhere . You are extinct -- as a county family . "
QUOTE	Q327	43	0	43	5	" That 's bad . "
QUOTE	Q328	44	0	44	24	" Yes -- what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male line -- that is , gone down -- gone under . "
QUOTE	Q329	45	0	45	7	" Then where do we lie ? "

QUOTE	Q332	48	0	48	6	" You have n't any . "
QUOTE	Q333	49	0	50	4	" Oh ? No lands neither ? "
QUOTE	Q334	51	0	52	32	" None ; though you once had 'em in abundance , as I said , for you family consisted of numerous branches . In this county there was a seat of yours at Kingsbere , and another at Sherton , and another in Millpond , and another at Lullstead , and another at Wellbridge . "
QUOTE	Q335	53	0	53	11	" And shall we ever come into our own again ? "
QUOTE	Q336	54	0	54	9	" Ah -- that I ca n't tell ! "
QUOTE	Q337	55	0	55	12	" And what had I better do about it , sir ? "
QUOTE	Q338	57	0	60	3	" Oh -- nothing , nothing ; except chasten yourself with the thought of ' how are the mighty fallen . ' It is a fact of some interest to the local historian and genealogist , nothing more . There are several families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre . Good night . "
QUOTE	Q339	61	0	62	27	" But you 'll turn back and have a quart of beer wi ' me on the strength o ' t , Pa ' son Tringham ? There 's a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure Drop -- though , to be sure , not so good as at Rolliver 's . "
QUOTE	Q340	63	0	64	6	" No , thank you -- not this evening , Durbeyfield . You 've had enough already . "

Well , Fred , I do n't mind telling you that the secret is that I 'm one of a noble race -- it has been just found out by me this present afternoon , P.M. "

QUOTE	Q348	85	0	87	23	" Never you mind the place , boy , that 's not the question before us . Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors -- hundreds of 'em -- in coats of mail and jewels , in gr ' t lead coffins weighing tons and tons . There 's not a man in the county o ' South-Wessex that 's got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I. "
