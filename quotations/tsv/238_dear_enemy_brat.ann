Also [ Jervis speaks ] she is getting interested in that confounded young Hallock , too good-looking and fascinating and erratic ; I never did like politicians . We must deflect her mind with some uplifting and absorbing occupation until the danger is past . Ha ! I have it ! We will put her in charge of the John Grier Home . "
