QUOTE	Q312	17	0	19	35	“ He does n’t generally go to town this time of year and he _ never _ visits ; if he ’d run out of turnip seed he would n’t dress up and take the buggy to go for more ; he was n’t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor . Yet something must have happened since last night to start him off . I ’m clean puzzled , that ’s what , and I wo n’t know a minute ’s peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today . ”

QUOTE	Q314	26	0	30	18	“ It ’s no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd , living away back here by themselves . Trees are n’t much company , though dear knows if they were there ’d be enough of them . I ’d ruther look at people . To be sure , they seem contented enough ; but then , I suppose , they ’re used to it . A body can get used to anything , even to being hanged , as the Irishman said . ”
