QUOTE	Q406	2	15	2	27	“ have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? ”
QUOTE	Q407	4	0	4	5	“ But it is , ”
QUOTE	Q408	4	9	4	26	“ for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . ”
QUOTE	Q409	6	0	6	12	“ Do you not want to know who has taken it ? ”
QUOTE	Q410	8	0	8	18	“ _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . ”
QUOTE	Q411	10	0	10	89	“ Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it , that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . ”
QUOTE	Q412	11	0	11	6	“ What is his name ? ”
QUOTE	Q413	12	0	12	3	“ Bingley . ”
QUOTE	Q414	13	0	13	7	“ Is he married or single ? ”
QUOTE	Q415	14	0	17	8	“ Oh ! Single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! ”
QUOTE	Q416	18	0	19	6	“ How so ? How can it affect them ? ”
QUOTE	Q417	20	0	20	6	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , ”
QUOTE	Q418	20	11	21	14	“ how can you be so tiresome ! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . ”
QUOTE	Q419	22	0	22	9	“ Is that his design in settling here ? ”
QUOTE	Q420	23	0	25	30	“ Design ! Nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . ”
QUOTE	Q421	26	0	27	44	“ I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party . ”
QUOTE	Q422	28	0	30	19	“ My dear , you flatter me . I certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . When a woman has five grown-up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . ”
QUOTE	Q423	31	0	31	16	“ In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . ”
QUOTE	Q424	32	0	32	21	“ But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . ”
QUOTE	Q425	33	0	33	13	“ It is more than I engage for , I assure you . ”
QUOTE	Q426	34	0	37	22	“ But consider your daughters . Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general , you know , they visit no newcomers . Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him if you do not . ”
QUOTE	Q427	38	0	39	52	“ You are over-scrupulous , surely . I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . ”
QUOTE	Q428	40	0	42	11	“ I desire you will do no such thing . Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good-humoured as Lydia . But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . ”
QUOTE	Q429	43	0	43	11	“ They have none of them much to recommend them , ”
QUOTE	Q430	43	15	43	37	“ they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . ”
QUOTE	Q431	44	0	46	9	“ Mr. Bennet , how _ can _ you abuse your own children in such a way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion for my poor nerves . ”
QUOTE	Q432	47	0	50	15	“ You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least . ”
QUOTE	Q433	51	0	51	11	“ Ah , you do not know what I suffer . ”
QUOTE	Q434	52	0	52	27	“ But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . ”
QUOTE	Q435	53	0	53	22	“ It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . ”
QUOTE	Q436	54	0	54	20	“ Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . ”
QUOTE	Q437	63	16	63	27	“ I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . ”
QUOTE	Q438	64	0	64	16	“ We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , ”
QUOTE	Q439	64	22	64	30	“ since we are not to visit . ”
QUOTE	Q440	65	0	65	7	“ But you forget , mamma , ”
QUOTE	Q441	65	11	65	30	“ that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him . ”
QUOTE	Q442	66	0	68	16	“ I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . ”
QUOTE	Q443	69	0	69	6	“ No more have I , ”
QUOTE	Q444	69	11	69	28	“ and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . ”
QUOTE	Q445	71	0	73	6	“ Do n't keep coughing so , Kitty , for Heaven 's sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . ”

QUOTE	Q451	78	0	78	7	“ Aye , so it is , ”
QUOTE	Q452	78	12	78	44	“ and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . ”
QUOTE	Q453	79	0	79	24	“ Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . ”
QUOTE	Q454	80	0	80	24	“ Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? ”
QUOTE	Q455	81	0	84	53	“ I honour your circumspection . A fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if _ we _ do not venture somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . ”

QUOTE	Q458	89	0	92	21	“ Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you _ there _ . What say you , Mary ? For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books and make extracts . ”
QUOTE	Q459	94	0	94	8	“ While Mary is adjusting her ideas , ”
QUOTE	Q460	94	12	94	20	“ let us return to Mr. Bingley . ”

QUOTE	Q462	96	0	98	22	“ I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did not you tell me that before ? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . ”
QUOTE	Q463	100	0	104	27	“ How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now . ”
QUOTE	Q464	105	0	105	14	“ Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , ”
QUOTE	Q465	106	0	106	10	“ What an excellent father you have , girls ! ”
QUOTE	Q466	108	0	110	27	“ I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me , either , for that matter . At our time of life it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes , we would do anything . Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . ”
