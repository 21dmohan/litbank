QUOTE	Q368	9	0	11	21	" True , Florence , but it is not years only that make a man old . Two great sorrows have embittered my life . First , the death of my dearly beloved wife , and next , the loss of my boy , Harvey . "
QUOTE	Q369	12	0	13	25	" It is long since I have heard you refer to my cousin 's loss . I thought you had become reconciled -- no , I do not mean that , -- I thought your regret might be less poignant . "

QUOTE	Q393	58	0	58	9	" That 's the sorrowful part of it , "
QUOTE	Q394	59	0	59	8	" That is what I most dread . "
QUOTE	Q395	60	0	60	32	" Then , since even if he were living you would not care to recognize him , why not cease to think of him , or else regard him as dead ? "

QUOTE	Q411	84	0	84	58	" Believe me , the loss of the property would affect me little , if you could be made happy by realizing your warmest desire ; but , uncle , I think it only the part of a friend to point out to you , as I have already done , the baselessness of any such expectation . "
QUOTE	Q412	85	0	85	10	" It may be as you say , Curtis , "

QUOTE	Q434	15	8	16	58	" If he had died , I might , as you say , have become reconciled ; but he was abducted at the age of four by a revengeful servant whom I had discharged from my employment . Heaven knows whether he is living or dead , but it is impressed upon my mind that he still lives , it may be in misery , it may be as a criminal , while I , his unhappy father , live on in luxury which I can not enjoy , with no one to care for me ----
