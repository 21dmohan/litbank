QUOTE	Q52	34	1	48	54	Hang the boy , ca n't I never learn anything ? Ai n't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time ? But old fools is the biggest fools there is . Ca n't learn an old dog new tricks , as the saying is . But my goodness , he never plays them alike , two days , and how is a body to know what 's coming ? He ' pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up , and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh , it 's all down again and I ca n't hit him a lick . I ai n't doing my duty by that boy , and that 's the Lord 's truth , goodness knows . Spare the rod and spile the child , as the Good Book says . I 'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both , I know . He 's full of the Old Scratch , but laws-a-me ! he 's my own dead sister 's boy , poor thing , and I ai n't got the heart to lash him , somehow . Every time I let him off , my conscience does hurt me so , and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks . Well-a-well , man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble , as the Scripture says , and I reckon it 's so . He 'll play hookey this evening , * and [ * Southwestern for “ afternoon ” ] I 'll just be obleeged to make him work , tomorrow , to punish him . It 's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays , when all the boys is having holiday , but he hates work more than he hates anything else , and I 've _ got _ to do some of my duty by him , or I 'll be the ruination of the child . ”
