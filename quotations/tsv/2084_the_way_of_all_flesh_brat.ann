QUOTE	Q352	41	9	43	58	" what did he do ? He could draw a little , but could he to save his life have got a picture into the Royal Academy exhibition ? He built two organs and could play the Minuet in _ Samson _ on one and the March in _ Scipio _ on the other ; he was a good carpenter and a bit of a wag ; he was a good old fellow enough , but why make him out so much abler than he was ?

QUOTE	Q354	44	9	48	2	" you must not judge by the work , but by the work in connection with the surroundings . Could Giotto or Filippo Lippi , think you , have got a picture into the Exhibition ? Would a single one of those frescoes we went to see when we were at Padua have the remotest chance of being hung , if it were sent in for exhibition now ? Why , the Academy people would be so outraged that they would not even write to poor Giotto to tell him to come and take his fresco away . Phew ! "
QUOTE	Q355	49	6	49	81	" if old Pontifex had had Cromwell 's chances he would have done all that Cromwell did , and have done it better ; if he had had Giotto 's chances he would have done all that Giotto did , and done it no worse ; as it was , he was a village carpenter , and I will undertake to say he never scamped a job in the whole course of his life .

QUOTE	Q359	52	15	55	75	" we must judge men not so much by what they do , as by what they make us feel that they have it in them to do . If a man has done enough either in painting , music or the affairs of life , to make me feel that I might trust him in an emergency he has done enough . It is not by what a man has actually put upon his canvas , nor yet by the acts which he has set down , so to speak , upon the canvas of his life that I will judge him , but by what he makes me feel that he felt and aimed at . If he has made me feel that he felt those things to be loveable which I hold loveable myself I ask no more ; his grammar may have been imperfect , but still I have understood him ; he and I are _ en rapport _ ; and I say again , Edward , that old Pontifex was not only an able man , but one of the very ablest men I ever knew .
