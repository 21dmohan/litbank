QUOTE	Q346	127	0	151	7	“ Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley , fifth daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell , Suffolk . Miss Cowley left the delights ( and drudgeries ) of her home life early in the war and came up to London , where she entered an officers ’ hospital . First month : Washed up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day . Second month : Promoted to drying aforesaid plates . Third month : Promoted to peeling potatoes . Fourth month : Promoted to cutting bread and butter . Fifth month : Promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail . Sixth month : Promoted to waiting at table . Seventh month : Pleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters ! Eighth month : Slight check in career . Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven ’s egg ! Grand row ! Wardmaid clearly to blame ! Inattention in such important matters can not be too highly censured . Mop and pail again ! How are the mighty fallen ! Ninth month : Promoted to sweeping out wards , where I found a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford ( bow , Tommy ! ) , whom I had not seen for five long years . The meeting was affecting ! Tenth month : Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in company with one of the patients , namely : the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford . Eleventh and twelfth months : Parlourmaid duties resumed with entire success . At the end of the year left hospital in a blaze of glory . After that , the talented Miss Cowley drove successively a trade delivery van , a motor-lorry and a general ! The last was the pleasantest . He was quite a young general ! ”

I had intended to become a land girl , a postwoman , and a bus conductress by way of rounding off my career -- but the Armistice intervened ! I clung to the office with the true limpet touch for many long months , but , alas , I was combed out at last . Since then I ’ve been looking for a job . Now then -- your turn . ”
QUOTE	Q351	162	0	162	10	“ There ’s not so much promotion in mine , ”
QUOTE	Q352	162	15	171	2	“ and a great deal less variety . I went out to France again , as you know . Then they sent me to Mesopotamia , and I got wounded for the second time , and went into hospital out there . Then I got stuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened , kicked my heels there some time longer , and , as I told you , finally got demobbed . And , for ten long , weary months I ’ve been job hunting ! There are n’t any jobs ! And , if there were , they would n’t give ‘ em to me . What good am I ? What do I know about business ? Nothing . ”
