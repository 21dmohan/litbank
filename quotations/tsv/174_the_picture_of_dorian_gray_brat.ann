QUOTE	Q296	7	0	7	17	" It is your best work , Basil , the best thing you have ever done , "
QUOTE	Q297	8	0	11	8	" You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor . The Academy is too large and too vulgar . Whenever I have gone there , there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures , which was dreadful , or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people , which was worse . The Grosvenor is really the only place . "
QUOTE	Q298	12	0	12	11	" I do n't think I shall send it anywhere , "
QUOTE	Q299	13	0	13	10	" No , I wo n't send it anywhere . "
QUOTE	Q300	15	0	22	34	" Not send it anywhere ? My dear fellow , why ? Have you any reason ? What odd chaps you painters are ! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation . As soon as you have one , you seem to want to throw it away . It is silly of you , for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about , and that is not being talked about . A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England , and make the old men quite jealous , if old men are ever capable of any emotion . "
QUOTE	Q301	23	0	23	9	" I know you will laugh at me , "
QUOTE	Q302	23	13	24	10	" but I really ca n't exhibit it . I have put too much of myself into it . "
QUOTE	Q303	26	0	26	18	" Yes , I knew you would ; but it is quite true , all the same . "
QUOTE	Q304	27	0	41	16	" Too much of yourself in it ! Upon my word , Basil , I did n't know you were so vain ; and I really ca n't see any resemblance between you , with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair , and this young Adonis , who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves . Why , my dear Basil , he is a Narcissus , and you -- well , of course you have an intellectual expression and all that . But beauty , real beauty , ends where an intellectual expression begins . Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration , and destroys the harmony of any face . The moment one sits down to think , one becomes all nose , or all forehead , or something horrid . Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions . How perfectly hideous they are ! Except , of course , in the Church . But then in the Church they do n't think . A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen , and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful . Your mysterious young friend , whose name you have never told me , but whose picture really fascinates me , never thinks . I feel quite sure of that . He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at , and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence . Do n't flatter yourself , Basil : you are not in the least like him . "
QUOTE	Q305	42	0	42	9	" You do n't understand me , Harry , "
QUOTE	Q306	43	0	55	45	" Of course I am not like him . I know that perfectly well . Indeed , I should be sorry to look like him . You shrug your shoulders ? I am telling you the truth . There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction , the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings . It is better not to be different from one 's fellows . The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world . They can sit at their ease and gape at the play . If they know nothing of victory , they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat . They live as we all should live -- undisturbed , indifferent , and without disquiet . They neither bring ruin upon others , nor ever receive it from alien hands . Your rank and wealth , Harry ; my brains , such as they are -- my art , whatever it may be worth ; Dorian Gray 's good looks -- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us , suffer terribly . "
QUOTE	Q307	56	0	57	5	" Dorian Gray ? Is that his name ? "
QUOTE	Q308	59	0	60	10	" Yes , that is his name . I did n't intend to tell it to you . "
QUOTE	Q309	61	0	61	5	" But why not ? "
QUOTE	Q310	62	0	71	10	" Oh , I ca n't explain . When I like people immensely , I never tell their names to any one . It is like surrendering a part of them . I have grown to love secrecy . It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us . The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it . When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going . If I did , I would lose all my pleasure . It is a silly habit , I dare say , but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one 's life . I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it ? "
QUOTE	Q311	72	0	72	5	" Not at all , "
QUOTE	Q312	72	10	79	13	" not at all , my dear Basil . You seem to forget that I am married , and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties . I never know where my wife is , and my wife never knows what I am doing . When we meet -- we do meet occasionally , when we dine out together , or go down to the Duke 's -- we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces . My wife is very good at it -- much better , in fact , than I am . She never gets confused over her dates , and I always do . But when she does find me out , she makes no row at all . I sometimes wish she would ; but she merely laughs at me . "
QUOTE	Q313	80	0	80	14	" I hate the way you talk about your married life , Harry , "
QUOTE	Q314	81	0	84	7	" I believe that you are really a very good husband , but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues . You are an extraordinary fellow . You never say a moral thing , and you never do a wrong thing . Your cynicism is simply a pose . "
QUOTE	Q315	85	0	85	16	" Being natural is simply a pose , and the most irritating pose I know , "
QUOTE	Q316	89	0	89	11	" I am afraid I must be going , Basil , "
QUOTE	Q317	89	15	89	36	" and before I go , I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago . "
QUOTE	Q318	90	0	90	5	" What is that ? "
QUOTE	Q319	92	0	92	6	" You know quite well . "
QUOTE	Q320	93	0	93	7	" I do not , Harry . "
QUOTE	Q321	94	0	96	6	" Well , I will tell you what it is . I want you to explain to me why you wo n't exhibit Dorian Gray 's picture . I want the real reason . "
QUOTE	Q322	97	0	97	8	" I told you the real reason . "
QUOTE	Q323	98	0	100	6	" No , you did not . You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it . Now , that is childish . "
QUOTE	Q324	101	0	101	3	" Harry , "
QUOTE	Q325	101	15	104	26	" every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist , not of the sitter . The sitter is merely the accident , the occasion . It is not he who is revealed by the painter ; it is rather the painter who , on the coloured canvas , reveals himself . The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul . "
